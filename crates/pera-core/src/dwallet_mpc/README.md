# dWallet MPC

This module contains the core logic of the MPC protocol for the dWallet.

## Development Notes

### Mocks for Development

The MPC includes complex logic, some of which takes a significant amount of time to run in `dev` mode.
To simplify development, you can use the following mocks:

#### Mocking the Class-Groups Key Generation

Each validator must generate a Class Groups key pair and proof of validity,
publish the public data (encryption key + proof), and store the decryption key.  
To bypass this process during development, you can mock the key generation by enabling the `mock-class-groups` feature
on the `dwallet-classgroups-types` crate.

#### Mocking the Network DKG Protocol

The MPC session requires the network DKG protocol to calculate the network MPC key.
However, running the network DKG protocol currently takes a significant amount of time (approximately 20 minutes in
`release` mode).  
To bypass this process during development, you can mock the network DKG protocol by disabling the `with-network-dkg`
feature on the `pera-core` crate.

### Generating the RPC API for TypeScript

To generate the RPC schema, follow these steps:

1. Run the `main` function from `crates/pera-open-rpc/src/generate_json_rpc_spec.rs`.
2. Then, run `pnpm tsx scripts/generate.ts` from the `sdk/typescript` directory.
