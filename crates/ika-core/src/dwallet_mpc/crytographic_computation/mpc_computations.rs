/// This function iterates over the messages from different parties sent for
/// different MPC rounds, ordered by the consensus round they were received.
///
/// It builds a list of messages to advance the current round `current_mpc_round`,
/// using all the messages from the first consensus round to the first that satisfies the
/// following conditions:
/// - a quorum of messages from the previous round `current_mpc_round — 1` must exist
///   (except for the first round, which is always ready to advance requiring no messages as input.)
/// - a minimum number of consensus rounds that was required to delay the execution
///   (to allow more messages to come in before advancing)
///   has passed since the first consensus round where we got a quorum for this round.
/// - This quorum must be "fresh", in the sense we never tried to advance with it before.
///   There is only one case in which we attempt to advance the same round twice:
///   when we get a threshold not reached error.
///   Therefore, if such an error occurred for a consensus round, we don't stop the search,
///   and wait for at least one new message to come in a later consensus round before returning
///   the messages to advance with.
///
/// Duplicate messages are ignored — the first message a party has sent for an MPC round
/// is always used.
