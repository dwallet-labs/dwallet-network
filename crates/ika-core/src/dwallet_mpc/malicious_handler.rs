//! This module handles the management of malicious actors in the MPC protocols.
//!
//! During an MPC session, parties attempting to disrupt the protocol
//! can be reported as malicious.
//! This module handles:
//! - Storing reported malicious actors.
//! - Ensuring these reports are only considered valid if submitted by a quorum of validators.
