To support GraphQL Queries, the Typescript SDK includes the `PeraGraphQLClient` which can help you
write and execute GraphQL queries against the Pera GraphQL API that are type-safe and easy to use.

## Writing your first query

We'll start by creating our client, and executing a very basic query:

```typescript
import { PeraGraphQLClient } from '@pera-io/pera/graphql';
import { graphql } from '@pera-io/pera/graphql/schemas/2024.4';

const gqlClient = new PeraGraphQLClient({
	url: 'https://pera-testnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql',
});

const chainIdentifierQuery = graphql(`
	query {
		chainIdentifier
	}
`);

async function getChainIdentifier() {
	const result = await gqlClient.query({
		query: chainIdentifierQuery,
	});

	return result.data?.chainIdentifier;
}
```

## Type-safety for GraphQL queries

You may have noticed the example above does not include any type definitions for the query. The
`graphql` function used in the example is powered by [`gql.tada`](https://gql-tada.0no.co/) and will
automatically provide the required type information to ensure that your queries are properly typed
when executed through `PeraGraphQLClient`.

The `graphql` function itself is imported from a versioned schema file, and you should ensure that
you are using the version that corresponds to the latest release of the GraphQL API.

The `graphql` also detects variables used by your query, and will ensure that the variables passed
to your query are properly typed.

```typescript
const getPeransName = graphql(`
	query getPeraName($address: PeraAddress!) {
		address(address: $address) {
			defaultPeransName
		}
	}
`);

async function getDefaultPeransName(address: string) {
	const result = await gqlClient.query({
		query: getPeransName,
		variables: {
			address,
		},
	});

	return result.data?.address?.defaultPeransName;
}
```

## Using typed GraphQL queries with other GraphQL clients

The `graphql` function returns document nodes that implement the
[TypedDocumentNode](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-typed-document-node) standard, and will
work with the majority of popular GraphQL clients to provide queries that are automatically typed.

```typescript
import { useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const chainIdentifierQuery = graphql(`
	query {
		chainIdentifier
	}
`);

function ChainIdentifier() {
	const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(getPokemonsQuery);

	return <div>{data?.chainIdentifier}</div>;
}
```
