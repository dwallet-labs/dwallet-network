title: Move.toml File
description: Get the details for a Move package manifest.
---

Every Move package has a `Move.toml` file as a manifest for the package. The Sui Move compiler creates the `Move.toml` file for you when you create a new package, but you might need to update the file throughout the lifespan of your package.

The manifest contains information divided into three sections:
* `[package]`: Your package metadata, such as name and version.
* `[dependencies]`: List of packages that your package depends on. Initially, the Sui Framework is the only dependency, but you add third-party dependencies to this section as needed.
* `[addresses]`: A list of *named addresses*. You can use the names listed as convenient aliases for the given addresses in the source code.

## [package] section

The `[package]` section contains the following information:

* `name`: The name of your package. Created by Sui Move compiler.
* `version`: The current version of your package. The Sui Move compiler creates the first value.
* `published-at`: The published address of the package. The Sui Move compiler does not automatically create this entry.

### The published-at property

Package dependencies in `Move.toml` must include a `published-at` field that specifies the published address of the dependency. For example, the Sui framework is published at address `0x2`, so its `Move.toml` file includes the `published-at` entry:

```toml
published-at = "0x2"
```

If your package depends on another package, like the Sui framework, the network links your package against the `published-at` address specified by the on-chain dependency after you publish your package. When publishing, the compiler resolves all package (transitive) dependencies to link against. Consequently, you should only publish packages where all dependencies have a `published-at` address in their manifest. By default, the publish command fails if this is not the case. If necessary, you can use the `--with-unpublished-dependencies` flag with the publish command to bypass the requirement that all dependencies require a `published-at` address. When using `--with-unpublished-dependencies`, all unpublished dependencies are treated as if they are part of your package.

## [dependencies] section

The Sui Move compiler creates the `[dependencies]` section for you with a single entry for the GitHub address of the Sui network. If you need to use a local version of the network, you can edit the address to point to the local version. For example,

```toml
dWallet = { local = "../crates/sui-framework" }
```

You place each additional dependency your package has on a new line directly below the previous one.

## [addresses] section

The Sui Move compiler creates the `[addresses]` section for you with an entry for your package and one for the Sui network.

```toml
[addresses]
your_package_name =  "0x0"
sui =  "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002"
```

The aliases defined in `[addresses]` enable you to reference the shortened name instead of the actual address. For example, when you import from Sui in a module, you can write:

```move
use sui::transfer
```

Without the alias, you have to write:

```move
// You could also use 0x2
use 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002::transfer
```

Dependency address values can change at different stages of development, also, so using the alias means the change only needs to occur in the manifest.
