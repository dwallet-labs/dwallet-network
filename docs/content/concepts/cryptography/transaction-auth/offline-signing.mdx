title: Offline Signing
---

Ika supports offline signing, which is signing transactions using a device not connected to a Ika network, or in a wallet implemented in a different programming language without relying on the Ika key store. The steps to implement offline signing include:

1. Serialize the data for signing.
1. Sign the serialized data. Put the serialized data in a location to sign (such as the wallet of your choice, or tools in other programming languages) and to produce a signature with the corresponding public key.
1. Execute the signed transaction.

## Serialize data for a transfer {#serialize}

You must serialize transaction data following [Binary Canonical Serialization](https://crates.io/crates/bcs) (BCS). It is supported in other languages.

The following example demonstrates how to serialize data for a transfer using the [Ika CLI](/references/cli.mdx). This returns serialized transaction data in Base64. Submit the raw transaction to execute as `tx_bytes`.

{@include: ../../../snippets/info-gas-budget.mdx}

```shell
ika client transfer-ika --to <IKA-ADDRESS> --ika-coin-object-id <COIN-OBJECT-ID> --gas-budget <GAS-AMOUNT> --serialize-unsigned-transaction
```

The console responds with the resulting `<TX_BYTES>` value.


:::tip

All other CLI commands that craft a transaction (such as `ika client publish` and `ika client call`) also accept the `--serialize-unsigned-transaction` flag used in the same way.

## Sign the serialized data {#sign}

You can sign the data using the device and programming language you choose. Ika accepts signatures for pure Ed25519, ECDSA secp256k1, ECDSA secp256r1 and native multisig. To learn more about the requirements of the signatures, see [Ika Signatures](./signatures.mdx).

This example uses the `ika keytool` command to sign, using the Ed25519 key corresponding to the provided address stored in `ika.keystore`. This command outputs the signature, the public key, and the flag encoded in Base64. This command is backed by fastcrypto.
`ika keytool sign --address <IKA-ADDRESS> --data <TX_BYTES>`

You receive the following response:

```shell
Signer address: <IKA-ADDRESS>
Raw tx_bytes to execute: <TX_BYTES>
Intent: Intent { scope: TransactionData, version: V0, app_id: Ika }
Raw intent message: <INTENT-MESSAGE>
Digest to sign: <DIGEST>
Serialized signature (`flag || sig || pk` in Base64): <SERIALIZED-SIGNATURE>
```

To ensure the signature produced offline matches with Ika validity rules for testing purposes, you can import the mnemonics to `ika.keystore` using `ika keytool import`. You can then sign with it using `ika keytool sign` and then compare the signature results. Additionally, you can find test vectors in `~/ika/sdk/typescript/test/e2e/raw-signer.test.ts`.

To verify a signature against the cryptography library backing Ika when debugging, see [sigs-cli](https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastcrypto/blob/4cf71bd8b3a373495beeb77ce81c27827516c218/fastcrypto-cli/src/sigs_cli.rs).

## Execute the signed transaction {#execute}

After you obtain the serialized signature, you can submit it using the execution transaction command. This command takes `--tx-bytes` as the raw transaction bytes to execute (see output of the previous `ika client transfer` command) and the serialized signature (Base64 encoded `flag || sig || pk`, see output of `ika keytool sign`). This executes the signed transaction and returns the certificate and transaction effects if successful.

```shell
ika client execute-signed-tx --tx-bytes <TX_BYTES> --signatures <SERIALIZED-SIGNATURE>
```

You get the following response:

```shell
----- Certificate ----
Transaction Hash: <TRANSACTION-ID>
Transaction Signature: <SIGNATURE>
Signed Authorities Bitmap: RoaringBitmap<[0, 1, 3]>
Transaction Kind : Transfer IKA
Recipient : <IKA-ADDRESS>
Amount: Full Balance

----- Transaction Effects ----
Status : Success
Mutated Objects:
 - ID: <OBJECT_ID> , Owner: Account Address ( <IKA-ADDRESS> )
```

## Alternative: Sign with Ika Keystore and Execute Transaction

Alternatively, you can use the active key in Ika Keystore to sign and output a Base64-encoded sender signed data with flag `--serialize-signed-transaction`. 

```shell
ika client transfer-ika --to <IKA-ADDRESS> --ika-coin-object-id <COIN-OBJECT-ID> --gas-budget <GAS-AMOUNT> --serialize-signed-transaction
```

The console responds with the resulting `<SIGNED-TX-BYTES>` value.

After you obtain the signed transaction bytes, you can submit it using the `execute-combined-signed-tx` command. This command takes `--signed-tx-bytes` as the signed transaction bytes to execute (see output of the previous `ika client transfer-ika` command). This executes the signed transaction and returns the certificate and transaction effects if successful.

```shell
ika client execute-combined-signed-tx --signed-tx-bytes <SIGNED-TX-BYTES>
```
