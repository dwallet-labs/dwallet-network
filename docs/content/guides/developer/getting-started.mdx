Ika is the first internet-scale programmable blockchain platform. That might read like marketing speak, but as you peruse the documentation to understand the technology, you will discover that Ika addresses many of the problems that hold blockchains back from mass adoption. 

Before you can get started developing on Ika, you need to understand the code repository and install its binaries. 

## Install Ika 

{@include: ../../snippets/quick-install.mdx}

You can also install Ika from binaries or from source, as detailed in the Install Ika page.

Go to [Install Ika](./getting-started/ika-install.mdx).

## After installing Ika

After you have Ika installed on your system, you can begin to connect with a network and publish smart contracts. 

- [Connect to a Ika Network](./getting-started/connect.mdx)
- [Connect to a Local Network](./getting-started/local-network.mdx)
- [Get Ika Address](./getting-started/get-address.mdx)
- [Get IKA Coins](./getting-started/get-coins.mdx)

## GraphQL queries

Use the GraphQL service for Ika RPC to interact with on-chain data. 

Go to [Query Ika RPC with GraphQL](./getting-started/graphql-rpc.mdx).
