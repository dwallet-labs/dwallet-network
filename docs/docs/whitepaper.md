# Ika Whitepaper

The Ika whitepaper introduces a distributed system of MPC signers that provides a comprehensive solution to blockchain interoperability challenges. It combines a Zero Trust cryptographic framework with an architecture optimized for performance and decentralization.

Key innovations include:

- Novel 2PC-MPC protocol for threshold cryptography
- Integration with Mysticeti consensus for reliable broadcast
- Architecture enabling secure, low-latency cross-chain interactions
- Zero Trust design eliminating single points of failure
- Infrastructure supporting high-throughput operations
- Scalable system design for decentralized participation

The whitepaper provides detailed analysis of:
- The blockchain interoperability problem space
- Technical architecture and protocols
- Real-world use cases and applications
- Governance mechanisms
- Security and performance characteristics
