# Install dWallet

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Your system needs the following prerequisites available to successfully install dWallet.

### Rust and Cargo {#rust-and-cargo}

dWallet requires Rust and Cargo (Rust's package manager) on all supported operating systems. The suggested method to install Rust is with `rustup` using cURL.

Some other commands in the installation instructions also require cURL to run. If you can't run the cURL command to install Rust, see the instructions to install cURL for your operating system in the following section before you install Rust.

Use the following command to install Rust and Cargo on macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

If you use Windows 11, see information about using the [Rust installer](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on the Rust website. The installer checks for C++ build tools and prompts you to install them if necessary. Select the option that best defines your environment and follow the instructions in the install wizard.

For additional installation options, see [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

dWallet uses the latest version of Cargo to build and manage dependencies. See the [Cargo installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) page on the Rust website for more information.

Use the following command to update Rust with `rustup`:

```bash
rustup update stable
```
### Additional prerequisites by operating system

Select the appropriate tab to view the requirements for your system.

:::info

The Linux instructions assume a distribution that uses the APT package manager. You might need to adjust the instructions to use other package managers.

:::

Install the prerequisites listed in this section. Use the following command to update `apt-get`:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

#### All Linux prerequisites

Reference the relevant sections that follow to install each prerequisite individually, or run the following to install them all at once:

- Rust and Cargo
- Git CLI
- CMake
- C++ build tools
- LLVM compiler

#### Additional tools for Windows {#additional-tools-windows}

Sui requires the following additional tools on computers running Windows.

- For Windows on ARM64 only - [Visual Studio 2022 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/).
- [C++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) is required to [install Rust](#rust-and-cargo).
- The [LLVM Compiler Infrastructure](https://releases.llvm.org/). Look for a file with a name similar to LLVM-15.0.7-win64.exe for 64-bit Windows, or LLVM-15.0.7-win32.exe for 32-bit Windows.

**Known issue** - The `sui console` command does not work in PowerShell.

## Install Sui binaries from source {#install-sui-binaries-from-source}

Run the following command to install Sui binaries from the `testnet` branch:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch testnet sui
```

The install process can take a while to complete. You can monitor installation progress in the terminal. If you encounter an error, make sure to install the latest version of all prerequisites and then try the command again.

To update to the latest stable version of Rust:

```shell
rustup update stable
```

The command installs Sui components in the `~/.cargo/bin` folder.

## Upgrade Sui binaries

If you previously installed the Sui binaries, you can update them to the most recent release with the same command you used to install them:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/dwallet-labs/dwallet-network.git dwallet 
```
