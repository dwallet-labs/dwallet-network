# dWallets

dWallets are programmable infrastructure components that revolutionize how we think about digital asset control. Unlike traditional wallets, dWallets are **programmable**, **transferable**, and **distributed** - enabling entirely new categories of blockchain applications.

## What Makes dWallets Special

Traditional wallets are simple key-pair tools for signing transactions. dWallets are sophisticated infrastructure that can:

- **Control Multiple Chains**: Single dWallet manages accounts on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Sui, and more
- **Execute Smart Logic**: Bound to smart contracts that enforce complex rules
- **Transfer Ownership**: Securely move between users or smart contracts
- **Maintain Security**: Distributed cryptography eliminates single points of failure

<Info>
Think of dWallets as "smart wallets" that can be programmed to follow custom logic while maintaining cryptographic security across multiple blockchains.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Chain Account Control

A single dWallet controls accounts across different blockchain protocols:

<Example title="Universal Portfolio Management">
One dWallet controls:
- **Bitcoin**: `bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh` 
- **Ethereum**: `0x742d35Cc6635C0532925a3b8D73e48e481F1a532`
- **Solana**: `DsVmJfrNqrQkGQmXwwh83u6g5e2z4T6H4q3q4j4R6xQ7`
- **Sui**: `0x5cf353484d7f512d44feae616910972659c9e10af431323f911e612a5ce6eec7`
- **Arbitrum**: `0x742d35Cc6635C0532925a3b8D73e48e481F1a532`

All derived from the same cryptographic key material, enabling unified management.
</Example>

### 2. Programmable Control

dWallets can be bound to smart contracts that define when and how they can operate:

```javascript
// Example smart contract logic
contract TreasuryManager {
  function authorizePayment(address recipient, uint256 amount) {
    require(governance.hasApproved(recipient, amount), "Not approved");
    require(amount <= dailyLimit, "Exceeds daily limit");
    
    dWallet.signTransaction({
      chain: "bitcoin",
      to: recipient,
      amount: amount
    });
  }
}
```

### 3. Transferable Ownership

dWallets can be securely transferred between users or smart contracts:

<Example title="DAO Treasury Transfer">
A DAO votes to transfer treasury management:

1. **Current State**: dWallet controlled by Treasury Committee
2. **Governance Vote**: DAO approves transfer to new management
3. **Secure Transfer**: Cryptographic ownership moves to new controllers
4. **New State**: New committee controls the same multi-chain assets

All assets remain in the same addresses - only control changes.
</Example>

## How dWallets Work

### Distributed Key Generation (DKG)

dWallets use [2PC-MPC cryptography](./cryptography/2pc-mpc) to distribute private key control:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant IkaNetwork as Ika Network
    participant Validators as Network Validators
    
    User->>User: 1. Generate random key material
    User->>IkaNetwork: 2. Submit key generation request
    
    IkaNetwork->>Validators: 3. Initiate DKG protocol
    Validators->>Validators: 4. Generate encrypted network shares
    
    par User Key Generation
        User->>User: 5a. Derive user key share
    and Network Key Generation  
        Validators->>Validators: 5b. Distribute encrypted shares
    end
    
    IkaNetwork->>User: 6. Return public key material
    User->>User: 7. Derive multi-chain addresses
    
    Note over User,Validators: Private key NEVER exists in one place
    Note over Validators: Each validator holds encrypted share
    Note over User: User controls ultimate access
```

**Key Properties:**
1. **User Share**: User generates and holds one cryptographic share
2. **Network Share**: Ika network holds the other share using threshold encryption
3. **Public Key Derivation**: Account addresses derived from the combined public key
4. **No Reconstruction**: Private key is never assembled or exposed

### Transaction Signing Process

When a dWallet needs to sign a transaction:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Initiates Transaction] --> B{dWallet Bound to Smart Contract?}
    
    B -->|Yes| C[Check Smart Contract Rules]
    B -->|No| D[Direct User Authorization]
    
    C --> E{Contract Approves?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Proceed with Signing]
    E -->|No| G[❌ Transaction Rejected]
    
    D --> F
    
    F --> H[User Generates Partial Signature]
    H --> I[Submit to Ika Network]
    
    I --> J[Network Validators Compute]
    J --> K[Combine Signature Components]
    K --> L[Generate Valid Signature]
    
    L --> M[Broadcast to Target Chain]
    M --> N[✅ Transaction Confirmed]

    style N fill:#c8e6c9,stroke:#388e3c,color:#000
    style F fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1976d2,color:#000
    style L fill:#fff8e1,stroke:#f57c00,color:#000
```

**Process Steps:**
1. **User Input**: Provides partial signature using their share
2. **Smart Contract Check**: Network verifies against bound contract logic (if any)
3. **Network Computation**: Nodes compute signature over encrypted network share
4. **Signature Assembly**: Components combined into valid transaction signature
5. **Broadcast**: Transaction sent to target blockchain

<Info>
The signing process is **non-interactive** from the user perspective - they submit their input and the network handles the rest.
</Info>

        J --> L[dWallet Signs Transaction]
        L --> M[Native Asset Transfer]
    end
    
    A --> D
    D --> J
    
    style A fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1976d2,color:#000
    style D fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#7b1fa2,color:#000
    style J fill:#c8e6c9,stroke:#388e3c,color:#000
    style K fill:#ffcdd2,stroke:#d32f2f,color:#000
    style M fill:#fff8e1,stroke:#f57c00,color:#000
```

**Real-World Examples:**

*Example 1: Cross-Chain Payment*
1. **Proposal**: "Pay 5 ETH to developer for smart contract audit"
2. **Voting**: DAO members vote on Sui governance contract
3. **Execution**: If approved, dWallet automatically signs ETH transfer
4. **Result**: Developer receives native ETH, no wrapped tokens or bridges

*Example 2: Multi-Asset Grant*
1. **Proposal**: "Fund research team: 1 BTC + 10,000 SUI + 5,000 SOL"
2. **Voting**: Reaches required threshold on Sui governance contract  
3. **Execution**: dWallet signs transactions on Bitcoin, Sui, and Solana simultaneously
4. **Result**: Team receives native assets across three different blockchains

**Benefits:**
- Native asset management across all chains
- Transparent governance with automatic execution
- No trust in treasury managers or custodians
- Emergency controls and spending limits built-in
</Example>

### Enterprise and Institutions

- **Custodial Services**: Secure asset management without single points of failure
- **Compliance Automation**: Enforce regulatory requirements programmatically
- **Multi-Signature Workflows**: Complex approval processes across chains
- **Audit Trails**: Complete transparency of all operations

### Gaming and NFTs

- **Cross-Game Assets**: Items that work across multiple gaming ecosystems
- **Programmable Ownership**: NFTs with built-in transfer rules
- **Tournament Prizes**: Automated distribution based on game results
- **Community Treasuries**: Player-governed asset management

## Lifecycle Management

### Creation
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for dWallet creation
const dWallet = await ika.createDWallet({
  chains: ["bitcoin", "ethereum", "solana", "sui"],
  bindToContract: "treasury-manager.sui",
  userShare: userKeyMaterial
});
```

### Operation
```javascript
// Smart contract controlled operation
await treasuryContract.requestPayment({
  recipient: "bc1q...",
  amount: "0.1 BTC",
  purpose: "Developer grant",
  dWallet: dWalletId
});
```

### Transfer
```javascript
// Transfer to new owner
await dWallet.transfer({
  newOwner: "new-committee.sui",
  approvals: governanceSignatures
});
```

## Security Properties

### Cryptographic Security
- **Distributed Control**: No single party can compromise the wallet
- **Threshold Security**: Requires multiple network participants
- **Public Verifiability**: All operations can be independently audited

### Smart Contract Security  
- **Programmable Rules**: Enforce custom logic before signing
- **Upgrade Protection**: Changes require governance approval
- **Emergency Stops**: Pause operations if needed

### User Security
- **Key Ownership**: Users always control their share
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Social recovery prevents permanent loss
- **Zero Trust Mode**: Optional user approval for every transaction

<Warning>
While dWallets provide strong security guarantees, users must still protect their key shares and any bound smart contracts should be thoroughly audited.
</Warning>

## Advanced Features

### Dynamic Participation
- Network nodes can join/leave without affecting wallet security
- Threshold automatically adjusts to maintain security guarantees
- No downtime during network changes

### Cross-Chain Atomic Operations
- Execute transactions across multiple chains atomically
- All transactions complete or none do
- Eliminates partial failure scenarios

### Composability
- dWallets can control other dWallets
- Create hierarchical management structures
- Build complex multi-chain applications

<Tip>
dWallets are building blocks - combine them with smart contracts to create sophisticated applications that weren't possible before.
