# Zero Trust Security

Zero Trust is the foundational security principle of Ika: **never trust, always verify**. Every operation requires cryptographic proof of user participation, eliminating reliance on trusted intermediaries.

## The Trust Problem

Traditional cross-chain solutions create honeypots - centralized points of control that attackers can target:

- **Centralized Bridges**: Require trusting bridge operators with billions in assets
- **Federated MPC**: Small groups of signers can collude or be compromised  
- **Custodial Services**: Single entities control user funds

<Warning>
Over $2.8 billion has been lost to bridge hacks since 2021, primarily due to centralized points of failure.
</Warning>

## Ika's Zero Trust Architecture

Ika eliminates these vulnerabilities through a distributed cryptographic framework where no single party can compromise user security.

### Cryptographic Participation Requirements

Every dWallet operation requires **both** user and network participation:

1. **User Share**: The user holds one cryptographic share of the private key
2. **Network Share**: Distributed across threshold of network nodes using homomorphic encryption
3. **Collaborative Signing**: Valid signatures require both shares working together

<Info>
The private key is **never reconstructed** - signatures are computed collaboratively without exposing the full key to any party.
</Info>

### Economic Security Alignment

Network participants are economically incentivized to behave honestly:

- **Proof of Stake**: Validators stake tokens to participate in consensus and MPC
- **Slashing Conditions**: Malicious behavior results in stake loss
- **Reward Distribution**: Honest participation earns transaction fees and staking rewards

## How Zero Trust Works in Practice

<Example title="Zero Trust Bitcoin Transaction Flow">
Here's exactly how Zero Trust works when sending Bitcoin from a dWallet:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant dWallet
    participant SuiContract as Smart Contract
    participant Network as Ika Network
    participant Bitcoin as Bitcoin Network
    
    User->>dWallet: 1. Request: Send 0.1 BTC to address
    dWallet->>User: 2. Generate partial signature with user key share
    User->>Network: 3. Submit partial signature + transaction
    
    Network->>SuiContract: 4. Verify against smart contract rules
    SuiContract-->>Network: 5. ✅ Transaction approved
    
    alt Smart Contract Approval
        Network->>Network: 6. Validators compute over encrypted shares
        Network->>Network: 7. Combine with user partial signature
        Network->>Bitcoin: 8. Broadcast valid Bitcoin transaction
        Bitcoin-->>User: 9. ✅ Transaction confirmed
    else Smart Contract Rejection
        SuiContract-->>Network: 6. ❌ Transaction rejected
        Network-->>User: 7. ❌ Transaction denied
    end
    
    Note over User,Bitcoin: Private key NEVER reconstructed
    Note over Network: Requires threshold of honest validators
    Note over User: User maintains ultimate control
```

**Zero Trust Guarantees:**
- ✅ User signature required for every transaction
- ✅ Smart contract logic enforced automatically  
- ✅ Threshold of network validators must participate
- ✅ Private key never reconstructed or exposed
- ❌ No single party can forge signatures or steal funds
</Example>

### Smart Contract Enforcement

dWallets can be bound to smart contracts that enforce additional security rules:

- **Multi-signature Requirements**: Require approval from multiple parties
- **Time Locks**: Prevent transactions until specific conditions are met
- **Spending Limits**: Automatically enforce daily/weekly transfer limits
- **Emergency Stops**: Allow authorized parties to pause operations

## Security Guarantees

### Cryptographic Security
- Based on well-established mathematical assumptions (ECDSA, threshold encryption)
- Threshold cryptography ensures security even with some compromised nodes
- Public verifiability allows anyone to audit operations

### Network Security  
- Byzantine fault tolerance up to 1/3 of stake being malicious
- Dynamic participation - nodes can join/leave without affecting security
- Consensus finality prevents reorganization attacks

### User Security
- Users retain ultimate control through their key share
- Optional Zero Trust mode requires user approval for every transaction
- Social recovery mechanisms prevent permanent key loss

<Tip>
Zero Trust doesn't mean zero convenience - users can delegate specific operations to smart contracts while maintaining cryptographic security guarantees.
