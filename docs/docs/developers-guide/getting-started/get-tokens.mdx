title: Get DWLT Tokens
---

The dWallet faucet is a useful tool for developers to get free test DWLT tokens,
allowing them to deploy and interact with their programs on dWallet's Testnet.
## Prerequisites

To request tokens from the faucet, you need a DWLT address that can receive the tokens.

## Find your DWLT Address
To find your DWLT address, run the following command:

```shell
dwallet client active-address
```

If you need to create a new DWLT address, follow the steps in [create a new DWLT Address](./get-address).

## Request Test Tokens via cURL

Use the following cURL command to request tokens from the faucet server:

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'http://faucet.alpha.testnet.dwallet.cloud/gas' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "FixedAmountRequest": {
        "recipient": "<YOUR DWLT ACCOUNT ADDRESS>"
    }
}'
```

If you are working with a local network,
replace `http://faucet.alpha.testnet.dwallet.cloud/gas` with `http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas`.

## Request Test Tokens via TypeScript SDK

You can also request tokens using the dWallet TypeScript SDK.

```typescript
import { requestSuiFromFaucetV0 } from '@dwallet-network/dwallet.js/faucet';

// get tokens from the Testnet faucet server
const response = await requestSuiFromFaucetV0({
    // connect to Testnet faucet
    host: 'http://faucet.alpha.testnet.dwallet.cloud/gas',
    recipient: '<YOUR DWLT ACCOUNT ADDRESS>',
});

console.log(response);
```

If you are working with a local network,
replace `'http://faucet.alpha.testnet.dwallet.cloud/gas'` with `'http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas'`.

## Test tokens on a local network

If you are running a local dWallet network, you can request tokens from your local faucet. For more details,
refer to the [Connect to a Local Network](./local-network.mdx#use-the-local-faucet) guide.
