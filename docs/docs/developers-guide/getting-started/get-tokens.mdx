# Get DWLT Tokens

The dWallet faucet is a useful tool for developers to get free test `DWLT` tokens,
allowing them to deploy and interact with their programs on dWallet's Testnet.

## Prerequisites

To request tokens from the faucet, you need a `DWLT` address that can receive the tokens.

### Find your DWLT Address

To find your DWLT address, run the following command:

```shell
dwallet client active-address
```

If you need to create a new DWLT address, follow the steps to [create a new DWLT Address](./get-address).

## Request Test Tokens via cURL

Use the following cURL command to request tokens from the faucet server:

```shell
curl -X POST --location "https://faucet.alpha.testnet.dwallet.cloud/gas" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
          "FixedAmountRequest": {
            "recipient": "<YOUR-ACTIVE-ADDRESS>"
          }
        }'
```

If you are working with a local network,
replace `https://faucet.alpha.testnet.dwallet.cloud/gas` with `http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas`.

## Request Test Tokens via TypeScript SDK

You can also request tokens using the dWallet TypeScript SDK.

```typescript
import {requestSuiFromFaucetV0 as requestDwltFromFaucetV0} from '@dwallet-network/dwallet.js/faucet';

// Get tokens from the Testnet faucet server.
const response = await requestDwltFromFaucetV0({
    // Connect to Testnet
    host: 'https://faucet.alpha.testnet.dwallet.cloud/gas',
    recipient: keypair.toSuiAddress(),
});

console.log(response);
```

If you are working with a local network,
replace `'https://faucet.alpha.testnet.dwallet.cloud/gas'` with `'http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas'`.

## Test tokens on a local network

If you are running a local dWallet network, you can request tokens from your local faucet. For more details,
refer to the [Connect to a Local Network](./local-network.mdx#use-the-local-faucet) guide.
