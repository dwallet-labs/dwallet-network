# MPC

## What is MPC — Multi Party Computation

MPC is a field of cryptography allowing a computation to be performed by multiple parties, without any party sharing
secret information. A common example of MPC is calculating the average salary of a group of employees, without any
employee revealing their salary to any other party.

MPC is based on rounds of communication between the parties for the computation to be performed. Although technically
generic MPC to perform any computation is possible, it is generally not efficient, and special MPC protocols are created
for specific use cases.

## TSS - Threshold Signature Scheme

The fundamental authentication method in blockchains relies on public key cryptography, specifically a private/public
key pair.
The private key grants full control over the blockchain address associated with the corresponding public key,
enabling cryptographic signatures.
Among these, ECDSA is the most widely used signature algorithm in blockchain systems.

However, the private key's **single point of failure** has been mitigated through Multi-Party Computation (MPC)
techniques, particularly with **Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS)** and **Threshold ECDSA protocols**.

Before the advent of 2PC-MPC protocols, most MPC schemes followed one of two models:

1. **Two-party protocol** – Two parties collaborate to generate an ECDSA signature instead of relying on a single
   private key.
2. **t-of-n threshold protocol** – A signature can be generated only when a threshold `t of n` participants agree,
   ensuring redundancy and reducing risk.

## DKG - Distributed Key Generation

TSS protocols generate signatures that are verifiable against a public key, just like a private key. For a public key to
exist for a group of parties, without any of them knowing the full private key, the parties are required to complete a
process called DKG, or Distributed Key Generation.

In Distributed Key Generation (DKG), a public key is created through a ceremony involving secret shares, which can be
used to generate signatures according to the protocol's rules (e.g., three out of five shares).

In the context of dWallets and 2PC-MPC, the DKG process constitutes the creation of a dWallet.
It involves generating both a user share, and a network share, with the latter encrypted by a network decryption key
used as part of the 2PC-MPC protocol.
